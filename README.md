This is a transparent web page where I only used the frontend, no backend no framework was used, onlyÂ HTMLÂ andÂ CSS.
So in this project, I just created a landing page where a transparent login page hasÂ beenÂ created.
You can see it from my guihub profile and if you want to clone it you can simply do that because there is no backend in it, just HTML andÂ CSSÂ wasÂ used.
ğŸ’¡Key Features: 
i.     Lightweight & fast loading 
ii.    Minimal yet elegant UI 
iii.   Glass morphism effect with transparency 
iv.    Smooth & clean aesthetics

This project showcases how CSS alone can create stunning, modern UI designs. I'm always exploring new ways to enhance Frontend Skills.
